## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Firebase Project
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Supabase Device Compatibility Checklist

To make auth and points updates work reliably across desktop and mobile browsers:

1. In Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> URL Configuration:
- Set Site URL to your production domain.
- Add Redirect URLs for both production and local dev (for example `http://localhost:3000/*`, `http://localhost:3001/*`, and your deployed domain).

2. In your deploy environment (Vercel/hosting), set all three variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

3. In browser testing, avoid private/incognito mode when validating persistent sessions.

4. Verify Realtime is enabled for `users` and `users_points` updates in Supabase.

### Running Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Native In-App Review (Capacitor)

This project includes a review helper in [src/lib/in-app-review.ts](src/lib/in-app-review.ts) that:

- Requests native in-app review in a Capacitor runtime (Android/iOS)
- Falls back to opening Play Store / App Store review pages
- Applies a local cooldown to avoid repeated prompts

To enable native dialogs in your Capacitor app, install a compatible review plugin in your mobile wrapper project and sync platforms. Example flow:

```bash
npm install @capacitor-community/in-app-review @capacitor/core
npm install -D @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync
```

This repository now includes:

- `capacitor.config.ts`
- `android/` and `ios/` native platform projects
- `www/` fallback web directory required by Capacitor sync

For production WebView loading from your deployed Next app, set `CAPACITOR_SERVER_URL` in your environment.

Then make sure these environment variables are set (see `.env.example`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IOS_APP_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_IOS_APP_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANDROID_APP_URL`

Important behavior notes:

- Play Store and App Store decide if/when to show the review dialog.
- A successful API call does not guarantee the popup is shown.
- Validate on Play internal testing / TestFlight builds, not only local debug installs.
- iOS builds must still be opened and signed on macOS with Xcode.
